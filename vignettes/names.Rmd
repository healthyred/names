**Abstract** The **names** package uses the graduation data of the senior class each year published in the Williams College Course Catalogs and reformats it into a data frame, so that the data can be easily manipulated. This is done for thirteen years from the Class of 2003 to the Class of 2015. The secondary component of this package creates different line graphs that display the proportions of Jewish people, and the level of merit received upon graduation.
