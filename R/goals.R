Goals: To create a project with the tools necessary to read all the names
into a data frame, and then apply whether each Last name in the data frame
matches if the person is of Jewish decent or not. Then attempt to make a
connection of their success rate at williams, of whether they graduated cum-laude
or with honors. Then create a table displaying change over time of
the number of Jewish students from williams that graduated with honors
or not. Use ggplot2 graphics in order to do so
