Title: Data Mining of Williams College Graduates
Version: 0.1.0
Author: person("Jian", "Lu", email = "jhl3@williams.edu", role = c("aut","cre"))
Description: This package uses the graduation data of the senior class each year published
    in the Williams College Course Catalogs and reformats it into a data frame, so that the
    data can be easily manipulated. This is done for thirteen years from the Class of 2003
    to the Class of 2015. The secondary component of this package creates different line
    graphs that display the proportions of Jewish people, and the level of merit received
    upon graduation.
